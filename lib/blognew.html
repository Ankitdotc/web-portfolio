                Find an ideal workplace corner at home- Firstly, do not put a computer screen/laptop near the window. The difference in the brightness of the screen and the outdoors may cause eye stress. Secondly, rearrange your desk in a way that it must be at a distance where you do not have to strain your eyes or stretch your neck to see whatâ€™s there on the screen, the ideal is 20-28 inches away from your face and your eyes at the level of middle of screen.
             <br></hr></li>

                Follow 20-20-20 rule- Take a break every 20-minutes and look at any object at least 20 feet away from you for 20 seconds.Do not hold digital devices closer to your eyes- There are concerns that digital devices might emit blue or other harmful lights that causes eye strain and when you hold them closer, it puts more stress on your eyes. So whenever you are using a smartphone or tablet, try to hold them as far as possible from your eyes. You may try enlarging the print for comfortable reading.
               <br></hr></li>
            <li><hr>
                Do not rub or unnecessarily touch your eyes- You shouldnâ€™t touch your eyes frequently. In-case of dry eyes or fatigue put refresh tears. Be sure to keep your hands clean. This will help keep germs from spreading to your face and your eyes.Also, please do not forget to clean and sterilize your laptops and mobile screens daily with a screen friendly alcohol wipe.
             <br></hr></li>
            <li><hr>
                If you have any emergency or urgent or a general query regarding any eye problem, do not hesitate to call to any eye care center. Visit your nearest Eye-Q eye hospital to take a comprehensive eye examination.
             <br></hr></li>
            <li><hr>
                   Excercise regularly. When you exercise regularly, the heart pumps blood to all organs, including the eyes. More oxygen and higher volume of blood to them makes them healthy and fit.Take regular gaps between working and rest your eyes by shutting them for some time. The glare from the computer and phone screens is particularly tiresome and can cause severe eye fatigue.
            <br></hr></li>
            <li><hr>
                Eat your green leafy vegetables and add more fruit to your diet. Whatâ€™s natural is what is good for your eyes. So add the spinach to your salad and have that apple instead of a bag of chips. Fish is especially beneficial for the eyes.Sleep is must for body.Resting your eyes at night will ensure their vitality for longer.
