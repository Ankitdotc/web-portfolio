      <strong<h1> Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a fundamental programming paradigm used by nearly every developer at some point in their career.

      <h2>What is Object-Oriented Programming? </h2>
      <p>Object-Oriented programming (OOP) refers to a type of programming in which programmers define the data type of a data structure and the type of operations that can be applied to the data structure.

        As Java being the most sought-after skill, we will talk about object-oriented programming concepts in Java. An object-based application in Java is based on declaring classes, creating objects from them and interacting between these objects.</p>
     <p>What are the four basic principles/ building blocks of OOP (object oriented programming)?
        The building blocks of object-oriented programming are Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction, and Polymorphism. Letâ€™s understand more about each of them in the following sequence:
        <ol>
     <li>Inheritance</li>
    <li>Encapsulation</li>  
     <li>Abstraction</li> 
     <li>Polymorphism</li>
    </ol>
    </p>   
    </hr>

    <h2>What are the benefits of Object Oriented Programming?</h2>
    <p> <ol>
           Improved productivity during software development 
           Improved software maintainability
           Faster development sprints
           Lower cost of development
           Higher quality software
    </ol>
   <li> Object Oriented Programming : Inheritance</li>
In OOP, computer programs are designed in such a way where everything is an object that interact with one another. Inheritance is one such concept where the properties of one class can be inherited by the other. It helps to reuse the code and establish a relationship between different classes.in Java, there are two classes:
<ol>
<li> Parent class ( Super or Base class)</li>

 <li>Child class (Subclass or Derived class ) </li>
</ol>

A class which inherits the properties is known as Child Class whereas a class whose properties are inherited is known as Parent class.

<p><small>There are four types of Inheritance.</small>

    <ol>
     <li> Single</li>  
      <li>Multilevel</li>
      <li> Hierarchial</li>
       <li> Hybrid</li>
    </ol>

    <h2><strong>Object Oriented Programming : Encapsulation</strong></h2>
    <p>Encapsulation is a mechanism where you bind your data and code together as a single unit. It also means to hide your data in order to make it safe from any modification. What does this mean? The best way to understand encapsulation is to look at the example of a medical capsule, where the drug is always safe inside the capsule. Similarly, through encapsulation the methods and variables of a class are well hidden and safe.

    width:30%"></img>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    We can achieve encapsulation in Java by:
    <ol>

 <li>Declaring the variables of a class as private.</li>
 <li>Providing public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.</li>
</ol>
</p>

    <h2>Abstraction and Polymorphism</h2>
    <p>Abstraction refers to the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events. It basically deals with hiding the details and showing the essential things to the user. If you look at the image here, whenever we get a call, we get an option to either pick it up or just reject it. But in reality, there is a lot of code that runs in the background. So you donâ€™t know the internal processing of how a call is generated, thatâ€™s the beauty of abstraction. Therefore, abstraction helps to reduce complexity. You can achieve abstraction in two ways:
      <ol>
       <li> Abstract Class  </li> 
        
        <li>Interface</li> 
    </ol>
    </p></hr>
    <hr>
   
    <p>Polymorphism means taking many forms, where â€˜polyâ€™ means many and â€˜morphâ€™ means forms. It is the ability of a variable, function or object to take on multiple forms. In other words, polymorphism allows you define one interface or method and have multiple implementations.
        Polymorphism in Java is of two types: 
        <ol>

<li>Run time polymorphism</li>
<li>Compile time polymorphism</li>
</ol>
    </p>
